<h2>User Microservice(includes Registration and logging in of a user) </h2>

Need to work on the following things to make it more robust. 
1. Password encryption.
2. JWT Token. (If it does not make an issue for the rest of the application.)
3. On pressing 'tab' the cursor should go to the corresponding input field on the right and not below the given field. 
4. Working on the Partials to make the errors visible without the help of javascript alerts. 
5. It is not taking 'Female' as the input. (it is okay---> Least priority.)
